            <h2>Our Business</h2>
            <p>
                Our company started when we noticed just how hard it is to get a good battering ram in the middle of a drawn out siege.
                Our founders banded together and created SiegeNut to solve the problems of the siege industry of the day.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our high-speed fleet of the latest ships and courier services get whatever you order to you in the fastest time possible, by land or by sea.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our trained crew of engineers and siegewrights can construct, fix, or walk you through assembling any piece of equipment on our market.
                We have the highest customer satisfaction rate among any company of our type.
